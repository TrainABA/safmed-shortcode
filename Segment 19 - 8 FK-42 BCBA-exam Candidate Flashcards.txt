FK-42 Rule Governed Behavior

[start]

[q]Define rule governed behavior
[a]Rule governed behavior - “Behavior governed by a rule (i.e., a verbal statement of an antecedent-behavior-consequence contingency), enables human behavior (e.g., fastening a seatbelt) to come under the indirect control of temporarily remote or improbable but potentially significant consequences (e.g., avoiding injury in auto accident). Often used in contrast to contingency-shaped behavior; a term used to indicate behavior selected and maintained by controlled, temporally close consequences” (Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2007, p. 703).
