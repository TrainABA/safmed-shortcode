FK-12 Stimulus Equivalence

[start]

[q]Define stimulus equivalence
[a]Stimulus equivalence - “The emergence of accurate responding to untrained and nonreinforced stimulus-stimulus relations following the reinforcement of responses to some stimulus-stimulus relations. A positive demonstration of reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity is necessary to meet the definition of equivalence” (Cooper, Heron & Heward, 2007, p. 705)”. 

[q]Define reflexivity
[a]Reflexivity - “A type of stimulus-to-stimulus relation in which the student, without any prior training or reinforcement for doing so, selects a comparison stimulus that is the same as the same stimulus” (Cooper, Heron & Heward, 2007, p. 702).

[q]Define symmetry
[a]Symmetry - “A type of stimulus-to-stimulus relationship in which the learner, without prior training or reinforcement for doing so, demonstrates the reversibility of matched sample and comparison stimuli” (Cooper, Heron & Heward, 2007, p. 705).

[q]Define transitivity
[a]Transitivity - “A derived stimulus-stimulus relation that emerges as a product of training two other stimulus-stimulus relations” (Cooper, Heron & Heward, 2007, p. 706).
