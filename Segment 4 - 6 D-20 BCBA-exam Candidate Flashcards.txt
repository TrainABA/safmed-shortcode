[q]Define/explain NCR.
[a]“Noncontingent reinforcement (NCR) is the presentation of a potential reinforcer on a fixed-time (FT) or variable time (VT) schedule independent of the occurrence of the target behavior. The response-independent presentation of the potential reinforcer eliminates the contingent relation between the target behavior and the stimulus presentation while allowing any effects of the stimulus presentation alone to be detected.” (Cooper, Heron & Heward, 2007).
