[q]Define matching to sample
[a]Matching-to-sample - “A procedure for investigating conditional relations and stimulus equivalence.

[q]Describe matching to sample
[a]A matching-to-sample trial begins with the participant making a response that presents or reveals the sample stimulus; next, the sample stimulus may or may not be removed, and two or more comparison stimuli are presented. The participant then selects one the comparison stimuli. Responses that select a comparison stimulus that matches the sample stimulus are reinforced, and no reinforcement is provided for responses selecting the nonmatching comparison stimuli” (Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2007, p. 699).
