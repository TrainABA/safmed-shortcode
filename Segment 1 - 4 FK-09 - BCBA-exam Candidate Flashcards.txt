[q] Define experimental analysis of behavior (EAB).

[a] The experimental analysis of behavior (EAB) is a natural science approach to the study of behavior.  The methodology includes rate of response as a basic dependent variable, repeated or continuous measurement of clearly defined response classes, within subject comparisons, visual analysis of data and an emphasis on describing functional relations between behavior and controlling variables.

[q] What distinguishes applied behavior analysis from EAB or behavioral service delivery?
[a] Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is a science that develops its technology based on the principles of behavior and applies them systematically to produce socially significant behavior change. Furthermore, experimentation is used to identify the independent variables responsible for behavior change. Lastly, the adequacy of ABA work is determined by the seven characteristics (applied, behavioral, analytic, technological, conceptually systematic effective and generalizable) set forth by Baer, Wolf and Risley (1968) (Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2007). 

[q] What distinguishes behavioral service delivery from EAB and ABA?
[a] Behavioral service delivery consists of putting ABA principles that have been experimentally validated into practice.  Behavioral service providers design, implement an evaluate behavior change procedures applied to socially significant behavior (Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2007). It is important that behavioral service providers apply a conceptual framework in order to offer a thorough explanation of the causes of behavior that are consistent with the established science of behavior. However it is also important that they can explain these concepts to non-behavioral service providers and families in everyday language by essentially, strengthening two verbal repertoires (Johnston, 2013).
